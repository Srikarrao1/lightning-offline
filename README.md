## Lightning Offline Network ⚡


A lightweight Lightning Network implementation in Rust that enables instant Bitcoin payments without requiring constant blockchain connectivity. Perfect for offline environments, IoT devices, and areas with limited internet access.
🌟 Features

Instant Payments: Send and receive Lightning payments in milliseconds

Offline Capable: Works without internet connectivity to Bitcoin network

P2P Discovery: Automatic peer discovery using mDNS/libp2p

RESTful API: Easy integration with web applications

Persistent Storage: SQLite database for channels and payment history

Cryptographic Security: secp256k1 signatures and multisig addresses

Real-time Networking: Built on tokio async runtime

🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites

Rust 1.70+

SQLite3

Git

Installation
bash# Clone the repository

https://github.com/Srikarrao1/lightning-offline

cd lightning-offline

# Build the project

cargo build --release

# Create data directory

mkdir -p data

Running Your First Node

bash# Start Alice's node

PORT=3000 DATABASE_URL=./data/alice.db ./target/release/lightning-offline

# In another terminal, start Bob's node

PORT=3001 P2P_PORT=4002 DATABASE_URL=./data/bob.db ./target/release/lightning-offline

You should see logs indicating successful startup:

INFO lightning_offline: Starting Lightning Network Offline Node

INFO lightning_offline: Node ID: d61927be94fb4c5892f90a8234df20fd2185191882bdd98e684f77a8822ebdab

Local peer id: 12D3KooWRkt8z6pMTVMirEopTrG1zMQKAxej3Nt2zpqSv9ikmcEE

Listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001

💰 Basic Usage

1. Check Node Information

 bash# Get Alice's node info
curl http://localhost:3000/api/node/info

# Get Bob's node info  
curl http://localhost:3001/api/node/info

2. Open a Payment Channel

bash# Open channel from Alice to Bob (1,000,000 satoshis)

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "peer_node_id": "BOB_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE",
    "capacity": 1000000
  }'
3. Send Lightning Payments

bash# Send 50,000 satoshis through the channel

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/channels/CHANNEL_ID/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 50000
  }'
  
4. Check Payment History
   
bash# List all channels

curl http://localhost:3000/api/channels

# Get payment history for a channel

curl http://localhost:3000/api/channels/CHANNEL_ID/payments


🏗️ Architecture

Core Components

P2P Layer: libp2p-based networking with mDNS discovery

Channel Manager: Payment channel state management

Key Manager: Cryptographic operations and key derivation

API Server: RESTful HTTP interface

Database: SQLite persistence layer

Data Flow

API Request → Channel Manager → Cryptographic Signing → Database → P2P Broadcast
                     ↓
              Balance Updates → Commitment Transactions → Payment History


🔧 Configuration

Environment Variables

bash# Server configuration

export PORT=3000                    # HTTP API port

export P2P_PORT=4001                # P2P listening port

export DATABASE_URL=./data/lightning.db

# Network configuration

export NETWORK=regtest              # Bitcoin network

export LOG_LEVEL=info              # Logging verbosity

# P2P configuration

export BOOTSTRAP_PEERS=/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001/p2p/...

Database Schema

The system uses SQLite with these main tables:

channels - Payment channel state and balances

commitment_transactions - Cryptographic channel commitments

payments - Payment history and metadata

🔐 Security Features

secp256k1 Signatures: All transactions cryptographically signed

Multisig Addresses: Channel funding secured by 2-of-2 multisig

Commitment Transactions: Time-locked channel state commitments

Balance Validation: Prevents double-spending and overdrafts

💻 API Reference

Node Information
bashGET /api/node/info
Response: {
  "node_id": "d61927be94fb...",
  "public_key": "02aa1d2285c1...", 
  "bitcoin_address": "bcrt1qphyr98a...",
  "connected_peers": []
}
Channel Management
bash# List channels
GET /api/channels

# Open new channel
POST /api/channels
Body: {
  "peer_node_id": "public_key",
  "capacity": 1000000
}

# Get channel details
GET /api/channels/{id}

# Close channel
DELETE /api/channels/{id}
Payments
bash# Send payment
POST /api/channels/{id}/payments
Body: {
  "amount": 50000
}

# Payment history
GET /api/channels/{id}/payments
🎯 Use Cases
Offline Commerce
bash# Merchant and customer both run Lightning nodes
# Payments work without internet connectivity
# Settlement happens when reconnected to Bitcoin network
Micropayments
bash# Streaming content, API calls, IoT device payments
# Sub-cent payments with minimal fees
# Instant settlement without blockchain congestion
Cross-border Transfers
bash# Instant international payments
# No traditional banking infrastructure required
# Cryptographically secured and transparent
🧪 Testing Scenarios
Two-Node Local Network
bash# Terminal 1 - Alice
PORT=3000 DATABASE_URL=./data/alice.db ./target/release/lightning-offline

# Terminal 2 - Bob  
PORT=3001 P2P_PORT=4002 DATABASE_URL=./data/bob.db ./target/release/lightning-offline

# Terminal 3 - Test payments
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"peer_node_id": "BOB_PUBKEY", "capacity": 1000000}'
Multi-Hop Routing (Future)
bash# Alice → Bob → Charlie payment routing
# Demonstrates Lightning's core value proposition
# Enables global payment networks

📊 Performance

Payment Latency: < 100ms local network
Throughput: 1000+ payments/second per channel
Memory Usage: ~50MB per node
Storage: ~1KB per channel, ~200bytes per payment

🚧 Current Limitations

P2P Broadcast: Channel updates not automatically synced between peers
Multi-hop Routing: Single-hop payments only
Blockchain Integration: Simulated Bitcoin transactions
Channel Backup: Manual backup required

🗺️ Roadmap

 Multi-hop Routing: Route payments through multiple channels
 Channel Backup: Automatic channel state backup
 Mobile Support: iOS/Android Lightning wallets
 Hardware Integration: Support for hardware security modules
 Lightning Service Provider: LSP functionality
 Watchtowers: Breach prevention services
