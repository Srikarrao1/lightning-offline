Offline Capable: Works without internet connectivity to Bitcoin network
P2P Discovery: Automatic peer discovery using mDNS/libp2p
RESTful API: Easy integration with web applications
Persistent Storage: SQLite database for channels and payment history
Cryptographic Security: secp256k1 signatures and multisig addresses
Real-time Networking: Built on tokio async runtime

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Rust 1.70+
SQLite3
Git

Installation
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lightning-offline.git
cd lightning-offline

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Create data directory
mkdir -p data
Running Your First Node
bash# Start Alice's node
PORT=3000 DATABASE_URL=./data/alice.db ./target/release/lightning-offline

# In another terminal, start Bob's node
PORT=3001 P2P_PORT=4002 DATABASE_URL=./data/bob.db ./target/release/lightning-offline
You should see logs indicating successful startup:
INFO lightning_offline: Starting Lightning Network Offline Node
INFO lightning_offline: Node ID: d61927be94fb4c5892f90a8234df20fd2185191882bdd98e684f77a8822ebdab
Local peer id: 12D3KooWRkt8z6pMTVMirEopTrG1zMQKAxej3Nt2zpqSv9ikmcEE
Listening on /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001
💰 Basic Usage
1. Check Node Information
bash# Get Alice's node info
curl http://localhost:3000/api/node/info

# Get Bob's node info  
curl http://localhost:3001/api/node/info
2. Open a Payment Channel
bash# Open channel from Alice to Bob (1,000,000 satoshis)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "peer_node_id": "BOB_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE",
    "capacity": 1000000
  }'
3. Send Lightning Payments
bash# Send 50,000 satoshis through the channel
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/channels/CHANNEL_ID/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 50000
  }'
4. Check Payment History
bash# List all channels
curl http://localhost:3000/api/channels

# Get payment history for a channel
curl http://localhost:3000/api/channels/CHANNEL_ID/payments
🏗️ Architecture
Core Components

P2P Layer: libp2p-based networking with mDNS discovery
Channel Manager: Payment channel state management
Key Manager: Cryptographic operations and key derivation
API Server: RESTful HTTP interface
Database: SQLite persistence layer

Data Flow
API Request → Channel Manager → Cryptographic Signing → Database → P2P Broadcast
                     ↓
              Balance Updates → Commitment Transactions → Payment History

🔧 Configuration
Environment Variables
bash# Server configuration
export PORT=3000                    # HTTP API port
export P2P_PORT=4001                # P2P listening port
export DATABASE_URL=./data/lightning.db

# Network configuration
export NETWORK=regtest              # Bitcoin network
export LOG_LEVEL=info              # Logging verbosity

# P2P configuration
export BOOTSTRAP_PEERS=/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001/p2p/...
Database Schema
The system uses SQLite with these main tables:

channels - Payment channel state and balances
commitment_transactions - Cryptographic channel commitments
payments - Payment history and metadata

🔐 Security Features

secp256k1 Signatures: All transactions cryptographically signed
Multisig Addresses: Channel funding secured by 2-of-2 multisig
Commitment Transactions: Time-locked channel state commitments
Balance Validation: Prevents double-spending and overdrafts

💻 API Reference
Node Information
bashGET /api/node/info
Response: {
  "node_id": "d61927be94fb...",
  "public_key": "02aa1d2285c1...", 
  "bitcoin_address": "bcrt1qphyr98a...",
  "connected_peers": []
}
Channel Management
bash# List channels
GET /api/channels

# Open new channel
POST /api/channels
Body: {
  "peer_node_id": "public_key",
  "capacity": 1000000
}

# Get channel details

🎯 Use Cases
Offline Commerce
bash# Merchant and customer both run Lightning nodes
# Payments work without internet connectivity
# Settlement happens when reconnected to Bitcoin network
Micropayments
bash# Streaming content, API calls, IoT device payments
# Sub-cent payments with minimal fees
# Instant settlement without blockchain congestion
Cross-border Transfers
bash# Instant international payments
# No traditional banking infrastructure required
# Cryptographically secured and transparent
🧪 Testing Scenarios
Two-Node Local Network
bash# Terminal 1 - Alice
PORT=3000 DATABASE_URL=./data/alice.db ./target/release/lightning-offline

# Terminal 2 - Bob  
PORT=3001 P2P_PORT=4002 DATABASE_URL=./data/bob.db ./target/release/lightning-offline

# Terminal 3 - Test payments
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/channels \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"peer_node_id": "BOB_PUBKEY", "capacity": 1000000}'
Multi-Hop Routing (Future)
bash# Alice → Bob → Charlie payment routing
# Demonstrates Lightning's core value proposition
# Enables global payment networks

🚧 Current Limitations

P2P Broadcast: Channel updates not automatically synced between peers
Multi-hop Routing: Single-hop payments only
Blockchain Integration: Simulated Bitcoin transactions
Channel Backup: Manual backup required

🗺️ Roadmap

 Multi-hop Routing: Route payments through multiple channels
 Channel Backup: Automatic channel state backup
 Mobile Support: iOS/Android Lightning wallets
 Hardware Integration: Support for hardware security modules
 Lightning Service Provider: LSP functionality
 Watchtowers: Breach prevention services
